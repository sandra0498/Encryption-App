This application prompts the user to choose between a caesar cipher or Vigenère Cipher to encrypt a message.

Caesar Cipher: 
asks for the user to input a message and encrypts the message with a randomized key 
~~~~~~

~~~~
Vigenère Cipher :
asks for the user to input a message, as well as a key (phrase) to encrypt the message
