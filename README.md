# Encryption-App
 
This application prompts the user to enter a word and uses a caeser cipher to encrypt the word, then returns the encrypted word to the user.

This application also uses a random generator to use as a shift in the cipher. 

***Still, in the process of working on edge cases (exceptions) of the app*******
** This app will not allow the user to insert a number, only ALPHABET **
